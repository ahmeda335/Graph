# Graph
## These codes show different types of graphs:
#### - Undirected Graph
#### - Directed Graph
#### - Weighted Undirected Graph
#### - Weighted Directed graph

## And show many different operations you can do on:
#### - Traversing using DFS.
#### - Traversing usin BFS.
#### - Knowing number of connected components
#### - Getting Topological Sort
#### - Getting Minimum Spanning Tree using Kruskal Algorithm
#### - Getting Minimum Spanning Tree using Prim's Algorithm
#### - Getting Shortest path using Dijkstra Algorithm
#### - MaxFlow - MinCut Algorithm

# Notes:
#### * The codes doesn't completely handle all cases, you can increase
####   what you want to meet your needs.

#### * When the user enter the graph the initial vertex must be '0' vertex
####   you can handle the code to begin from index '1' if you want.

#### * There are some files of codes that depend on each other, so if you 
####   want to run one you must download the other, and download the needed
####   required libraries
